 * gradually enables *some* of this extracted functionality while falling back
 * to the legacy copy in this codebase for the rest.

 * TODO: Hook this up to the request chain and fall through to the existing handler.
 * TODO: `@netlify/images` follows a different pattern (it is used directly).
 * Move that here.
